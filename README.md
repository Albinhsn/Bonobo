## TODO

[ ] Make sure you free on interpreter error

* change OP_STRUCT_ARG in compiler
* figure out if you need everthing through every path etc

### Aggressively refactor to minimize code 
* figure out how to remove std::vector locals
* dynamic array sizes rather then fixed


### Features to fix
* tabs/spaces > {}

* setup ci for timed tests

* write formal grammar


* Builtins:
    * io  
    * len/size
    * ? : 
    * iterate over array/map
